This is a super simple party bot so you can get free cheapEth in an automated manner.
Is cheapEth the future? Hell yeah!

## Usage
Before deploying create a `.env` file containing the follwing vars: 

```Bash
TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN
PARTYTOKENS=party,ðŸš€,paaaaaarty
```

Now you can simply run the bot by calling `python3 bot.py`

## Client Usage
The bot will listen to all messages that start with one of the `PARTYTOKENS`. If the message has the format `[PARTYTOKEN] [ADDRESS]` the bot will store the free cTH request. If someone tries to spam or get money multiple times the spamed messages will be deleted and the users gets an error message.
